handling missing values techniques are imputation and dropping.
In machine learning, two common techniques for handling missing values are imputation and dropping. 
Imputation fills missing values with estimates, such as using the mean, median, or mode for numerical or categorical data. More advanced methods like K-nearest neighbors (KNN) can also be used. Imputation helps retain dataset size and prevents data loss.
Dropping involves removing rows or columns with missing values. While simpler, it may lead to the loss of important information, especially if missing values are widespread. Dropping is useful when the missing data is minimal or not crucial.
The choice between imputation and dropping depends on the extent of missing data and the importance of retaining information.
